Exercise 9¶
OK, so CE-20170824.pdf is just a paper someone wrote using this data. 
Since the name CE-20170824.pdf doesn’t tell us anything about this paper, let’s rename it using the mv command. 
Recall from DataCamp that mv stands for move, but that while it is moving files it can also rename them. 
If you “move” something from its current location back to its current location but with a different name, you’ve effectively re-named it!.
So try re-naming CE-20170824.pdf to something more descriptive.


Solution:

Macaws-MacBook-Pro:NYC_311calls_2018 hakunamatata$ mv CE-20170824.pdf Elections_and_ConstituencyResponsiveness.pdf
