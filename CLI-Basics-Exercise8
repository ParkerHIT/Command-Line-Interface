Exercise 8¶
Let’s use the open command (on a mac) or the start command (if you’re using a bash shell on windows). open FILENAME / start FILENAME 
just asks your computer to do whatever it would do if you double-clicked on FILENAME. 
So if you type open CE-20170824.pdf / start CE-20170824.pdf, your computer will open the PDF in your default PDF reader.


Solution:

Macaws-MacBook-Pro:NYC_311calls_2018 hakunamatat$ open CE-20170824.pdf

Terminal Response:

Opens the file in the PDF Reader Application.
