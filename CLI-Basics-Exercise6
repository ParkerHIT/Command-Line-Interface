Exercise 6¶ EXPLORING FILES

You can see the actual 1’s and 0’s that underlay a file from the command line using the command xxd -b [filename]. First, use this to see what’s in just_the_letter_a.txt file.

Solution:
Macaws-MacBook-Pro:NYC_311calls_2018 hakunamatata$ xxd -b just_the_letter_a.txt
Terminal Response:
00000000: 01100001 00001010  

What you will see is a counter on the left, a colon, then the actual contents of the file grouped into sets of 8 bits (what’s called a byte). The first is the code for a lower case “a” (01100001). The second is the code that says “this is the end of the current line”. And that’s it! Congratulations, you can now read binary!
